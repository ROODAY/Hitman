TGN Hitman
==========
***A version of the Hitman GMod Gamemode, edited by TGN Gaming***   

**How to play:**   
The traitors are now called Hitmen. Hitmen have a name on the bottom of their screen, who is their target.   
Hitmen have to kill their target, and their target only, before a new target is assigned to them.   
Killing someone other than your designated target will result in all the players being notified of you being a hitman.   
The radars for Hitmen work much closer to realtime, allowing for easier finding of targets. Hitmen also have the traitor shop.   

The detectives, for now, have been replaced with Jihadists. The Jihadist has no alliances and must kill whoever they can with their jihad.   
The Jihadist spawns with weapons that do not damage people, and a jihad. The weapons cannot be dropped, and this is to make sure the Jihadist plays fair.   
Jihadists also spawn with a cloaking device, which is activated by right clicking when equipped, which makes them almost invisible.   
Should a Jihadist acquire credits, the detective shop is available to them.   

Civilians are simply rebranded innocents. Nothing special here.   

Enjoy!
